Which components constitute core functionality?
0. Method for calculating _time until Elevator is on ground floor, ready to accept new Passengers
1. Assigning Floor _zone to _available Elevators based on _time
2. Adding/removing Passengers from Elevator
3. Facilitating the "movement" of the Elevator, which can eventually be translated to processing

Big questions/comments:
1. Must first develop a terminal output to display the placement of Passengers into their assigned Elevators
2. How will Elevators "move" and drop off Passengers (how will _time change?)

Timeline:
May 25th - Elevator class fitted with instance variables, and appropriate accessors and mutators
May 26th - Completed Passenger class
May 28th - Complete Core Functionality tasks 0-2
May 30th - Start Control class which will serve as driver file
June 2nd - Start work with processing, assuming everything else works
June 6th - Finished with project!! We expect some difficulty with the processing, and therefore plan to give ourselves some extra time to add features and do the processing.
July 6th - Sell our optimized elevator class for millions of dollars to Google. ;)
