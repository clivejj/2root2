Which jobs are most crucial?

We need to finish implementing the timing functionality into the ControlTower. 
Once this is complete, we wil be able to run constant waves of people, which will showcase our ELevator's optimization.
Also, we must decide what data fields should enter the csv file.
We must implement a real-time processing graphic to display the ranges of the Elevators (using colors and numbers), 
and whether or not they are moving.

Which components constitute non-essential functionality?

Another model Elevator that does not have a range. We could use this as a compasrison to our Elevator.

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?

6/1: Completed timing mechanism. The code can run with constant waves, and print outputs.
6/2: Desired data fields are saved to a csv upon each simulation.
6/5: Processing completed. A real-time graphic shows all the elvator's ranges, and whether or not they are moving.
6/6: Non-essential functionality completed.
