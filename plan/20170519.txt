Which components constitute core functionality?
0. Method that takes PriorityQueue and places the queue in different elevators such that the trip is optimized
1. Prioritized elevator ordering
2. Algorithm to choose which elevator every user goes to
3. Some sort of time tracking to later translate to processing.

Big questions/comments:
1. Must first develop a terminal output to display the optimized elevator before development of graphics.
2. How to prioritize? (some sort of minimizer for floors visited per elevator, also accout for CEO priority etc)

Timeline:
May 25th - Method mentioned under ore functionality number 0. completed. This is the core of our idea.
May 30th - finished with basic elevator class. Hopefully also added some user functionality so user can change
           number of elevators, users with different priorities etc. Begin work on extra features and processing. 
June 6 - Finished with project!! We expect some difficulty with the processing, and therefore plan to give ourselves 
         some extra time to add features and do the processing.
July - Sell our optimized elevator class for millions of dollars to Google. ;)
