Which jobs are most crucial?

We need to verify that out current timing mechanism is running properly. We will need to do this by running lots of tests, and analyzing the resulting data.
We must store this data (likely to be waitTime, dropoffTime, and destination) in a csv
We must implement a real-time processing graphic to display the ranges of the Elevators (using colors and numbers), and whether or not they are moving.

Which components constitute non-essential functionality?

Another model Elevator (basically a regular Elevator that one might encounter) that does not have a range. We could use this as a comparison to our Elevator.

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?

6/3: Desired data fields are saved to a csv upon each simulation.
6/5: Processing completed. A real-time graphic shows all the elevator's ranges, and whether or not they are moving.
6/6: Non-essential functionality completed.
